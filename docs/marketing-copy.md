# Portal 28 Marketing Copy & Brand Voice

## Brand Overview

**Portal 28** isn't a course hub. It's a threshold.

A private clubhouse for founders, creators, and CEOs who know they're meant to operate at a higher level—and are done playing small with their story, their voice, and their brand.

The number **28** is about authority, wealth-building, leadership, and earned power. Not hype. Not hustle. Real command.

> You don't stumble into this room. You unlock it.

This is where strategy meets intuition.
Where storytelling becomes leverage.
Where the AI age stops being scary—and starts working for you.

## Brand Voice Guidelines

### Tone
- **Confident & Commanding** — Not arrogant, but assured
- **Direct** — Short, punchy sentences. No fluff.
- **Evocative** — Almost poetic, creates imagery
- **Sophisticated** — Premium feel without being pretentious
- **Action-Oriented** — "You don't leave with ideas. You leave with a usable, scalable brand story."

### What We Sound Like
- "Step inside the room where power gets built."
- "Posting isn't the problem. Posting without a story is."
- "Your audience shouldn't just consume your content. They should feel like they're inside a story—and you're the one leading it."

### What We Don't Sound Like
- Generic marketing speak
- Hustle culture hype
- Overpromising/salesy
- Vague or wishy-washy

## About the Founder

Hi, I'm Sarah. I build brands that actually mean something.

I'm the founder of Portal Copy Co., where I help founders, creatives, and operators turn messy ideas into clear, powerful messaging—and turn that messaging into momentum.

I've spent years at the intersection of:
- brand strategy
- storytelling
- content systems
- and now, AI-powered creation

Portal 28 is the evolution of that work.

> This platform exists for people who don't just want better copy—they want command over their narrative.

## Course Descriptions

### AI Age Brand Story Boot Camp
**Build a brand story that survives the algorithm.**

The AI Age Brand Story Boot Camp is for founders who feel like:
- their brand sounds generic online
- their message gets lost the second it hits social media
- they "know" their story but can't articulate it clearly

This boot camp gives you:
- a clear brand narrative that actually sounds like you
- a story framework that works across website, social, offers, and launches
- a way to use AI without losing your voice or your edge

> You don't leave with ideas. You leave with a usable, scalable brand story.

### Social Storytelling
**Turn content into a narrative people follow.**

Posting isn't the problem.
Posting without a story is.

The Social Storytelling course teaches you how to:
- stop posting one-off content
- build an ongoing narrative across platforms
- position yourself as someone people trust, follow, and buy from

This is for creators and founders who want:
- cohesion instead of chaos
- presence instead of pressure
- content that compounds over time

> Your audience shouldn't just consume your content. They should feel like they're inside a story—and you're the one leading it.
